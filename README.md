# Secure-Shell-Key-Generator
A simple script used to generate SSH key
This script uses the paramiko module to generate a new RSA key pair and save the private key and public key to separate files. The private key is saved to a file called id_rsa and the public key is saved to a file called id_rsa.pub.

To use the script, simply run it and it will generate and save the SSH key pair. You can then use the generated keys to authenticate SSH connections.
